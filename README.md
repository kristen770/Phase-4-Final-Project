# Overview  
For the Phase 4 Final Project I chose to model Time Series Data from [Zillow Research](https://www.zillow.com/research/data/) data. The task was to act as consultant advising an investor on the "5 best zipcodes" to invest in. The data from Zillow included the average price of single family home sales each month from from 1996 - 2018 accross the US. This project showcases technical skills such as Pandas, proficiency with Time Series, and ARIMA modeling as well as soft skills such as domain knowledge, data driven insights and strong analysis. 

# Project Senario 

InvesTex is a real estate investment firm looking to make value buys in the Dallas/ Fort Worth Metroplex. Looking to buy low sell high the client is targeting a  18-36 month turn around on investment. They have asked for the 5 best zipcode to invest in. Using domain knowledge in conjunction with the data 'best' will be defined using the following metrics: 
1. Zipcodes location within or near a high preforming school disctrict 
2. Zipcodes relative price compared to other zipcode in the school disctrict 
3. Zipcodes that preform with highest yields for forcasted home prices. 
4. Other factors such as average lot size and permit favoribility may also be considered
